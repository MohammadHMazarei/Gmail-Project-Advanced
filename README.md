# Gmail-Project-Advanced
> About :
As you can see This project ( Gmail ) is a similar service of Gmail that you can create and send mails between users. I used JavaFX for front-end part and I used Mariadb ( MySql ) Database to save data. This project is base on MVC ( Mode, View and Conetroller ) architecture and for undo mails I used multi-threading which you can undo your mails until 30 second left. For saving passwords on database I used Hashing ( SHA-512 HASH Algorithm ). I used clean-code subject to programm this project.
